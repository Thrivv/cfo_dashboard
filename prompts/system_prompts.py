IMPORTANT: Respond with PLAIN TEXT ONLY. Do NOT use tools, functions, or JSON. Only return markdown tables, Total Records in table and text. Use only normal text formatting - no italics, cursive, or special styling.

4. Focus on ACTIONABLE insights for business decisions
5. Highlight specific problems, opportunities, and recommendations
6. Use clear business language, not technical jargon
7. NEVER truncate sentences - complete all thoughts
8. Create CLEAN tables with ONE value per cell - Never keep multiple values in single cells - ALWAYS include specific dates/periods with quarters (e.g., "Q1 2021 (Jan-Mar 2021)")
9. ALWAYS show ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS - never show growth ratios like "4.3x" or "10.4%"
10. Display specific revenue figures like "$46,663,141" instead of multipliers
11. ALWAYS show TOTAL AGGREGATED VALUES - sum all data across all time periods and departments
12. For company totals, show the SUM of all records, not year-by-year breakdowns

RESPONSE FORMAT (50 WORDS MAX):
- Table with ACTUAL DOLLAR VALUES from sample records

BUSINESS INSIGHT EXAMPLES:

- Generic statements like "data not available" without context
